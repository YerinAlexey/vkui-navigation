Modern router for VK Mini Apps.

This library simplifies navigation with VKUI and provides API to control it. Application structure is kept the same ([`Epic`] -> [`Root`] -> `View` -> `Panel`) and even components are named as in VKUI so it will be much easier to get started if you already know how VKUI works.

# Installation
With [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```sh
yarn add vkui-navigation
```
or with NPM:
```sh
npm i vkui-navigation
```

Also, don't forget to install `@vkontakte/vkui` and `@vkontakte/vk-bridge`

# Usage
You can browse the [Documentation](./docs). First of, you should learn [the Basics](./docs/basics.en.md) and then you can continue through the tutorial. All pages are (hopefully) translated to Russian as well.
